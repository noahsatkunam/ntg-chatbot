## Service URLs (Production)

- **Frontend**: https://your-domain.com
- **Backend API**: https://api.your-domain.com
- **Health Check**: https://api.your-domain.com/api/health
- **Grafana**: https://monitoring.your-domain.com:3000
- **Prometheus**: https://monitoring.your-domain.com:9090

## Critical Endpoints to Test

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Current user info
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh

### Chat Functionality
- `GET /api/conversations` - List conversations
- `POST /api/conversations` - Create conversation
- `POST /api/conversations/:id/messages` - Send message
- WebSocket connection for real-time chat

### Knowledge Base
- `POST /api/knowledge/documents` - Upload document
- `GET /api/knowledge/documents` - List documents
- `POST /api/knowledge/search` - Search documents

### Health and Monitoring
- `GET /api/health` - Application health
- `GET /api/ready` - Readiness check
- `GET /api/live` - Liveness check
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected after deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-production.sh rollback
   ```

2. **Database Rollback** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec postgres psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -d $POSTGRES_DB < backup.sql
   ```

3. **Service Restart**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart
   ```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Application Performance**
  - Response times (< 500ms for API calls)
  - Error rates (< 1%)
  - Uptime (> 99.9%)
  
- **Infrastructure**
  - CPU usage (< 80%)
  - Memory usage (< 85%)
  - Disk usage (< 90%)
  - Network latency

- **Business Metrics**
  - Active users
  - Chat messages per minute
  - Document uploads
  - Authentication success rate

### Alert Thresholds
- API response time > 1000ms
- Error rate > 5%
- CPU usage > 90%
- Memory usage > 95%
- Disk usage > 95%
- Database connection failures
- Redis connection failures

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups
- **Database**: Daily full backup, hourly incremental
- **File Storage**: Daily backup of uploaded documents
- **Configuration**: Weekly backup of configuration files

### Backup Retention
- Daily backups: 30 days
- Weekly backups: 12 weeks
- Monthly backups: 12 months

### Backup Verification
- Weekly restore tests
- Monthly disaster recovery drills

## Security Considerations

### Regular Security Tasks
- [ ] SSL certificate renewal (every 90 days)
- [ ] Security patches applied monthly
- [ ] Dependency updates reviewed weekly
- [ ] Access logs reviewed daily
- [ ] Security scan performed monthly

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Monitoring alerts or user reports
2. **Assessment**: Determine severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve processes

## Maintenance Windows

### Scheduled Maintenance
- **Weekly**: Security updates (Sunday 2-4 AM UTC)
- **Monthly**: System updates (First Sunday 2-6 AM UTC)
- **Quarterly**: Major updates and optimizations

### Emergency Maintenance
- Critical security patches: Within 24 hours
